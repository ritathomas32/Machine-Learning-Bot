# Module_14_Challenge: Machine Learning Trading Bot
In this Challenge, we are assuming the role of a financial advisor at one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world. Our firm constantly competes with the other major firms to manage and automatically trade assets in a highly dynamic environment. In recent years, your firm has heavily profited by using computer algorithms that can buy and sell faster than human traders.

The speed of these transactions gave your firm a competitive advantage early on. But, people still need to specifically program these systems, which limits their ability to adapt to new data. You’re thus planning to improve the existing algorithmic trading systems and maintain the firm’s competitive advantage in the market. To do so, we will  enhance the existing trading signals with machine learning algorithms that can adapt to new data.

We were requested to divide the challenge into the following sections:

- Establish a Baseline Performance

- Tune the Baseline Trading Algorithm

- Evaluate a New Machine Learning Classifier

- Create an Evaluation Report

**Technologies used:**

- Pandas

- Numpy

- Hvplot

- Scikit-learn
